# Overview
This self-paced tutorial aims to provide a comprehensive, one-stop resource for understanding the fundamentals of neural networks without the need for GPUs or internet access.  This tutorial series is split into five parts:
(1) an overview of neural networks
(2) the math behind forward and back propagation
(3) MNIST classification with a MLP in NumPy
(4) MNIST classification with a MLP in PyTorch
(5) MNIST classification with a CNN in PyTorch
Along the way, I provide offline PDF resources with more detailed and/or supplemental information.

# Getting started
After completing the following steps, you will be able to get working with no need for anymore internet access or GPUs.
